    "### Introduction to Data Pipelines\n",
    "#### Pipeline\n",
    "* Series of connected processes\n",
    "* Output of one process is input of the next\n",
    "* Includes low-level hardware architecture\n",
    "* Software-driven processes - commands, programs, and threads\n",
    "* Bash 'pipe' command can connect such processes together\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Pipeline\n",
    "* Purpose is to move data from one place or form to another\n",
    "* Any system which extracts, transforms, and loads data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Design Considerations\n",
    "Pipeline Latency - time it takes for a single packet of data to pass through the pipeline\n",
    "Throughput - number of data the can be fed through the pipeline per unit\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Use Cases\n",
    "* Backing up files - no change needed\n",
    "* Integrating disparate raw data sources into a data lake\n",
    "* Moving transactional records to a data warehouse\n",
    "* Streaming data from IoT devices to dashboards\n",
    "* Preparing raw data for machine learning development or production\n",
    "* Messaging systems such as email, SMS, video meetings\n",
