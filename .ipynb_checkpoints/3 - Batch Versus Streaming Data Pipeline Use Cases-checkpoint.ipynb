    "### Batch Versus Streaming Data Pipeline Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Batch Data Pipelines\n",
    "- Can be initiated based on data size or other triggers\n",
    "- Used when latest data isn't needed\n",
    "- Typical choice when accuracy is critical\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Streaming Data Pipelines\n",
    "- Ingest data packets in rapid succession\n",
    "- For real-time results\n",
    "- Records/events proecssed as they happen\n",
    "- Event streams can be loaded to storage\n",
    "- Users publish/subscrive to event streams\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Micro-batch Data Pipelines\n",
    "- Tiny micro-batches and faster processing simulate real-time processin\n",
    "- Smaller batches improve load balancing, lower latency\n",
    "- When short windows of data are required for transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "- Tradeoff between accuracy and latency\n",
    "- Data cleaning improves quality, but increases latency\n",
    "- Lowering latency increases potential for errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lambda Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "- A hybrid architecture designed for handling data\n",
    "- Combines batch and streaming data pipeline methods\n",
    "- Historical is delivered in batches and Real time data is streamed through speed layer\n",
    "- Final node is called a serving layer\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary\n",
    "- Data stream fills in latency gap\n",
    "- Used when data window is needed but speed is critical\n",
    "- Drawback is the complexity of implementation"
